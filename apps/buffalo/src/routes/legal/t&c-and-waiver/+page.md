However, by enrolling in any of the services or activities delivered by Grappling Coaching Services Limited, you do so at your own risk and Grappling Coaching Services Limited, its owners, employees and coaches will not be held liable for any personal injury or loss of property during any of our sports programmes, holiday camps, events or any other programmes that are delivered by Grappling Coaching Services Limited. By enrolling in any of Grappling Coaching Services Limited services and activities, you affirm that you and/or your child is in suitable physical condition to exercise. Your/his/her participation is purely voluntary and in no way mandated by Grappling Coaching Services Limited. Also, you understand that you/he/she can stop anytime if he/she has any discomfort or even without any particular reason. All adult participants (or, if under 18, their parent/legal guardian) must agree prior to their first ‘Buffalo Jiu-Jitsu’ Jiu-Jitsu training session delivered by Grappling Coaching Services Limited by agreeing to and submitting this combined terms & conditions and waiver form.

### Enrolment:

If you enroll with Grappling Coaching Services Limited, you are enrolling either for a single training session or a full calendar month and its stated number of session\[s\] & as such will need to pay the full course ticket. Grappling Coaching Services Limited agrees to deliver the stated number of sessions as paid for by you.

Payment should be made in full for the enrolled session/month before the first session.

You/your child can enroll for a one-time-only free trial week (subject to course availability); all subsequent sessions will be charged as either single sessions or a calendar month payment at the discretion of Grappling Coaching Services Limited.

Weather & Cancellation Policy:

All sessions/events will be cancelled if the HK Observatory raises:

– Black Rainstorm warning.

– Typhoon No. 8 Signal.

Outdoor sessions/events will be canceled if the Air Quality Health Index reaches level 10 in the affected areas of the session(s)/event(s) in question.

Any other cancellations due to bad weather will be at the discretion of Grappling Coaching Services Limited and will be credited against any future payment unless a make up session may be provided if and when possible. Credits may be given to you/your child in the form of a coupon upon your request. The coupon must be used within the same year period. Credits are non-refundable.

Sessions will be credited if a student misses a session for other reasons but at the discretion of Grappling Coaching Services Limited. Sessions will not be credited/refunded if you/your child withdraw from a calendar month/session after it commences unless the withdrawal is due to health or relocation.

### Lesson Etiquette:

You/your child should arrive on time to training sessions/events to enjoy the maximum benefit. Arriving late may disrupt the training session/event for the coach and students.

Students aged 2 - 5 years old are required to be accompanied by a parent / guardian at all times. Students aged 2 - 3 years old need to be assisted during sessions.

In the event you are a parent/guardian collecting your child at one of our training sessions, please be on time as coaches are not responsible for your child outside of a given training session time. If you cannot collect your child, you need to inform Grappling Coaching Services Limited immediately.

Grappling Coaching Services Limited has full control over its lessons and students and reserves the right to expel any students from a course on the grounds of unacceptable behaviour towards the coaches and/or fellow students and/or bystanders. A credit/refund will be offered for any remaining lessons.

### Hygiene, Sports Attire and What to Bring:

It is the responsibility of all adult students/parents/guardians to ensure they/their children are clean, dry and dressed in proper sports attire for each lesson. Clean attire, a clean body and hair and short and clean fingernails and toenails are required, and students who do not meet these standards may be asked to leave until they are ready to meet these standards. Students are required to wear the complete uniform to all training sessions: Jiu-Jitsu rashguard/compression top/well-fitting T-shirt, and shorts (without pockets). No shoes or socks may be worn by Jiu-Jitsu students inside Buffalo Strength Gym, especially on the blue Jiu-Jitsu mats. Off the mats, flip-flops (strictly used indoors only) are required to be worn off the blue Jiu-Jitsu mats. Jewellery, accessories, rings/studs/open piercings are not allowed.

COVID-19, Influenza & Other Health or Safety-Related Warnings:

‍In the event of tightened government restrictions surrounding COVID-19, a rise in influenza cases or any political disturbances preventing the legal and safe operation of our training sessions, the session(s) and/or course(s) will be cancelled and credit will be issued towards future enrolments. No refunds will be awarded for missed training sessions/events due to COVID-19 or any other health or safety-related outbreak.

### Events Policy:
