# Patch Notes

### **Inspired by**

- **Andreas' patch-notes**
- [**Arcaneeye - Fixing Stealth dnd 5e**](https://arcaneeye.com/dm-tools-5e/fixing-stealth-dnd-5e/)

# Additions

## Actions

### Step

A step lets you temporarily move into a square within 5 feet, then move back without provoking attacks of opportunity.

A step costs 5 feet of movement and an action or bonus action

A step cannot be performed while:

- Underwater
- Airborne
- Slowed

### Focus

Focus grants advantage on mental (INT, WIS, CHA) saving throws, as well as saving throws to maintain concentration until the start of your next turn.

## Stealth Initiative

During stealth out of combat, Stealth Initiative rules will be used.

### Awareness Track

| State    | Effect             |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Unaware  | Passive Perception |
| Cautious | Active Perception  |
| Alert    | Active Searching   |
| Aware    | Aware of Location  |

- If you fail a Stealth check, the NPC will move -1 on the Awareness Track
- If you fail a stealth check by 5 or more the NPC will move -2 on the Awareness Track
- If you succeed on a Stealth Check the track does not change
- If you succeed by 5 or more than the track moves +1

### Turns

- Players receive their typical actions.
- Players will have to make a Stealth check as a Free Action at the end of their turn.
- **Hide** gives you +2 to your Stealth check.
- **Dash** disadvantage on Stealth check until end of turn.

### Distraction

Using at least one free hand, you may make a Deception check against the targetsâ€™s Perception check.

#### If you succeed

- You can cause the target to move up to 10 feet in any direction (the target avoids any plainly dangerous areas)
- The target receives -5 to Perception checks until the beginning of your next turn.

#### If you fail

- You receive a -2 to your next Stealth check.
