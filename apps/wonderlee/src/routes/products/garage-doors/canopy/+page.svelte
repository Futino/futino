      Unlike sectional garage doors that horizontal sections are joint together
      by hinges, canopy garage doors have a 1-piece door panel that will form a
      canopy when fully open

      <h3>How does canopy garage door work</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Door frame is constructed by extruded Aluminum.</li>
        <li>
          Frosted tempered glasses in-fill give the door its unique modern look.
        </li>
        <li>
          The door panel is guided by tracks and balanced by a spring system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Electrically operated garage door opener opens or closes the garage
          door quietly and locks it completely when closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other advanced features such as auto-reverse upon obstruction and
          auto-light further enhance safety and convenience.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="flex flex-col">
      <h3>Advantage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          As part of the door panel stays out when fully opened, canopy door
          needs less space to install, ideal for garage with ceiling
          obstruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Semi-transparent frosted tempered glasses provide light for the garage
          during the day. At night, it becomes a light source for the yard
          outside with garage lights turned on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aluminum and glass will never rust, prefect for the humid weather in
          Hong Kong.
        </li>
      </ul>
