      <h3>How does electrically operated slide gate opener work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The weight of the gate rest on a level rail. Depending on the length,
          the gate is guided by a number of roller bracket sets for opening and
          closing. There is no chance of derailing the gate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Microprocessor inside the opener received encrypted signal from the
          remote control, amongst other operation such as auto reversal upon
          obstruction and recognizing up to 16 remote control, opens or closes
          the door electrically with a motor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The gate opener only needs to overcome inertia and friction to move
          the gate. Gate can go up to 10 meter in length and 500 Kg in weight.
          Material can be stainless steel, wrought iron, brass, Aluminum or
          glass.

        <li>
          Soft-start/soft-start and smooth movement at around 20cm per second.
        </li>
        <li>Partial open in pedestrian mode.</li>
        <li>
          Infra-red sensor for added protection, it will reverse door movement
          upon detection of possible obstruction.

        <li>
          Optional auto-closing preset by internal timer and external lighting
          control.
