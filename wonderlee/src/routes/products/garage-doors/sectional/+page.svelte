          The weight of the garage door is counter-balanced by the torsion
          spring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Microprocessor inside the opener received encrypted signal from the
          remote control, amongst other operation such as auto reversal upon
          obstruction and recognizing up to 16 remote control, opens or closes
          the door electrically with a motor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The garage door opener only needs to overcome friction to lift or
          lower the door much faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the power rail is right above the middle of the door and acts along
          its center of gravity, door movement is much more stable and as a
          result, quieter.
